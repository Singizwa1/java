            <h2>What Are We Solving?</h2>
            <p> After careful observation, we realized that most people faced problem of not being able to meet their doctor because they didn't have an appointment before showing up at the hospital. In some cases, people travel long distances back from their villages to get treatment from big hospitals where they always find themselves spending more than they can afford thus a waste of resources. And on the doctors side, we find most of them are treating a bigger number of people per day than they should, thus putting the patient at risk.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution?</h2>
            <p>The solution tho the above problems is no other that <strong>HiDoctor</strong>. An app that helps make an appointment with your doctor at the hospital of your choice from the comfort of your home. This is to save time for the people who go to the hospital and go back home without being treated due to not having an appointment. And also it will give the hospital stuff a clear schedule of a given day and how many appointments they have to deal with through out the day.</p>
